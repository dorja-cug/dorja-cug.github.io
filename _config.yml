  Hello! Born in Zagreb, Croatia I graduated from the School of Art, Design, Graphics and Clothing Zabok, majoring in media technician. I've got a bachelor's degree in AV media from the Baltic Film School, and am continuing my studies at TLÃœ as a Master's degree student at Digital Learning Games.<br>
  I am the author of several short films, almost all of which were shortlisted at multiple film festivals, with some winning awards. I've also worked on mumerous other films, mainly as a production designer.<br><br>
  As a game designer I have written for several projects, and did basic 2D/3D art and environmental design.
