  Hello! I was born in Zagreb, Croatia. I graduated from the School of Art, Design, Graphics and Clothing Zabok, majoring in media technician. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in AV media from the Baltic Film School, and am continuing my studies at TLÃœ as a Master's degree student at Digital Learning Games.<br>
  I am the author of several short films, almost all of which were shortlisted at multiple film festivals, with some winning awards.<br><br>
